# Welcome to SpaceTrivia
SpaceTrivia is a static space trivia game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

***

## Overview
Upon opening SpaceTrivia the user is met with instructions for the game.  Essentially, they have thirty seconds to answer each question and there are ten total.  Once 'start' has been clicked the game commences and the timer starts.  If the timer runs out the program will move on to the next question.  If a choice has been made, the user will be told whether their selection was correct or not.  The user then has to choose to move on to the next question.  After each question has been rendered and they have been answered or the timer has expired, the 'end game page' will open.  The last page will show the user's results and offer them the otion to go to the home page or start the quiz again.
